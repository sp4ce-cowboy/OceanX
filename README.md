# OceanX
An archive of my team's work for the East Zone A*STAR Science Fair 2016.

### Overview
My team and I created an autonomous submersible rover propelled by 6 brushless DC (BLDC) motors supporting 6-Axis motion control, equipped with O2 sensors, temperature sensors and pH sensors powered by an Arduino Uno, to monitor the ecological conditions of Victoria School's Koi pond.

### Project Scope
This project was a joint submission for the East Zone A*STAR Science Fair 2016 held externally, and the Social Innovation Project held internally by Victoria School's Integrated Programme department.

We won the Bronze Award (and $100 cash vouchers) in the Upper Secondary Category. Some articles written by the school can be found on the school's website [here](https://www.victoria.moe.edu.sg/announcements/2016/east-zone-astar-science-festival-bronze/) and the school's facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/victoriaschoolsingapore/posts/congratulations-to-suresh-rubesh-4i-ivan-feng-4j-syed-wazir-4k-and-wayne-yeo-4kt/879824925455004/).
